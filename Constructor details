Constructors in Java:
Types of constructors
Default Constructor
Parameterized Constructor
Constructor Overloading
Does constructor return any value?
Copying the values of one object into another
Does constructor perform other tasks instead of the initialization
In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.

Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.

It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.

There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.

Note: It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation. It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesn't have any.

Rules for creating Java constructor
There are two rules defined for the constructor.

Constructor name must be the same as its class name
A Constructor must have no explicit return type
A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
Note: We can use access modifiers while declaring a constructor. It controls the object creation. In other words, we can have private, protected, public or default constructor in Java.
Types of Java constructors
There are two types of constructors in Java:

Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
Parameterized constructor

Constructor Overloading in Java
In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods.

Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.

Example of Constructor Overloading
//Java program to overload constructors  
class Student5{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    int age;  
    //creating two arg constructor  
    Student5(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
    //creating three arg constructor  
    Student5(int i,String n,int a){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    age=a;  
    }  
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name+" "+age);}  
   
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Student5 s1 = new Student5(111,"Karan");  
    Student5 s2 = new Student5(222,"Aryan",25);  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
   }  
}  
Test it Now
Output:

111 Karan 0
222 Aryan 25

Difference between constructor and method in Java
There are many differences between constructors and methods. They are given below.

Java Constructor	Java Method
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.	A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.	A method must have a return type.
The constructor is invoked implicitly.	The method is invoked explicitly.
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class.	The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
The constructor name must be same as the class name.	The method name may or may not be same as the class name.
