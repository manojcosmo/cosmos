Why we need constructr in java?

Before constructor, we initialize the variables and object by creating objects. e.g.
ob.emp_id=101;
ob.emp_name="Manoj";
.
.
.

If there are 1000 employes in the company we need to created 1000 objects and 2000 lines to intialize the values of object.{which is not good programming}
but after using constructor, we can intialize the values of instance variable by using parameterizes constructor.

Employee ob = new Employee(102,"Parisha");
